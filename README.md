## Description

As a University of Washington Coding Boot Camp student, I want to further my back-end developing capabilities by using Express.js to build a server that handles requests from a web client and manages a flat-file database. This project makes taking and organizing any notes a breeze. Create, edit, save, and delete notes all within the web client while the server applies your changes to the database.

## Installation

No installation necessary.

## Usage

To use the application, open the link in [Deployed](#deployed). Use the "+" button in the top right to create a new blank note. Use the right panel to draft the note's title and body. Use the save button in the top right to save the note once it contains some text. The left panel will display all of the saved notes and give the user the option to delete any of them.
